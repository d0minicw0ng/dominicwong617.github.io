It's been more than 3 years since I wrote my first line of code. I started
programming by teaching myself via various online and offline resources,
Codecademy, Udacity, Ruby on Rails Tutorial...you name it. Most of the time,
I just read the texts and follow the code examples. While I still have learned
a lot from the experts, I think I sometimes have the problem of trying to learn
too much and not doing enough.

New technologies come out every day and many programmers are afraid of being
phased out because they are using an 'prehistoric' technology. I too am paranoid
about this sometimes. As a Rails developer, whenever I hear about someone saying
'Node.js will replace Rails', 'Golang is so much faster than Ruby', 'Rails programmers
will only be able find maintenance projects to work on', my heart does skip a beat
even I know the truth is people always hype about new technologies. Perhaps I am
still too inexperienced to be confident in my skill. This tendency, however, leads to
my habit of thinking that I have to learn all the new technologies to keep up with the
game.

Hence, I spend too much time learning and not enough time applying my existing knowledge.
Of course, learning is good, but only consuming knowledge via a third party is not very
helpful because there's only so much you can retain. Since it's not your personal experience,
you won't have a vivid memory of why certain things work certain ways. I learn the most
whenever I get my hands dirty. I remember taking a Code School AngularJS course last year and I
seemed to understand everything, but it was just a very shallow introduction. Surely I didn't
remember much. Later on I had the chance to work on an AngularJS project, only via the
documentation digging and painful debugging did I really learn the skill to my heart.
Especially when it comes to programming, doing is (almost) always better than learning.

The lesson for me is to take a balance. I am a very avid reader (not only in technology
materials), which is a good thing, but I need to do more and learn less. When I am so busy
devouring texts every day, I am not really digesting the knowledge. To really learn the
essence of a subject, it's absolutely necessary to write your own programs/book reviews/whatever
creative work it is. People who only follow instructions and consume information don't get anywhere,
the successful ones are the people who can create something out of nothing.
